    "text": "Hello. I am Brandon Lo, a Biological Science student at University of California Santa Barbara. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's of Science degree While I am not studying, I can be found, being a teaching assistant for a lab, or working on side projects. I enjoy hiking, traveling, and exploring in general. At night, I love looking up to the stars and I secretly hope that one day interstellar travel will be easily accessible."
